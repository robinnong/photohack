# Photo Inspo - Search Photos and Get Inspired

This project was built during the Mintbean #CareeHack 4-hour hackathon - the objective was to a built any front-end application using an image search API. I chose to build a simple React application that allows users looking for photographic inspiration to search and curate a selection of images from Pexels. Try it out <a href="https://robinnong.github.io/photohack/">here</a>.

To Do:
- Added loading / transitional elements between slow loading images and on page load
- Preload images
